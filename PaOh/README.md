This layout is based on the widely-used PaOh Myanmar Unicode keyboard layout by Khun Soe Zaw Thu, popular among Pa'O Windows users. This version includes support for Pa'O digits.

To type Pa'O digits:

**Windows:** Alt + Digit keys (0-9)  
**Mac:** Option + Digit keys (0-9)

## Important Note

Pa'O digits were added in Unicode 16.0, so most fonts do not yet include them and the characters may appear invisible. This is a font limitation, not a keyboard issue.
